/// move them somewhere (in a new variable, function ...)

/// - `String`: Heap-allocated UTF-8 string

///
/// A slice is a **reference to a contiguous sequence** of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.

/// - **Non-owning**: Just borrows the data (doesn't own it)
/// - **Contiguous**: Always refers to a continuous sequence
/// - **Flexible**: Can refer to any portion of the original data
///
/// ## Key Characteristics
/// - **Zero-cost**: No runtime overhead over raw pointers
/// - **Bounds-checked**: Access is safe (panics on out-of-bounds)
/// - **Flexible**: Can refer to arrays, vectors, or other slices
/// - **Borrow rules apply**: Follow same borrowing rules as references

/// # Golden Rule of Slice Parameters
///
/// **"If the reference you want to pass to a function is sliceable,
///  then implement the function to accept a slice."**
///
/// ## Why This Rule Works
///
/// 1. **Maximum Flexibility**:
///    - Accepts `&[T]`, `&Vec<T>`, `&Array<T>`, and other sliceable types
///    - Works with both stack and heap allocated data
///
/// 2. **Zero-Cost Abstraction**:
///    - No runtime overhead for the abstraction
///    - Compiles to the same code as if you used concrete types
///
/// 3. **API Ergonomics**:
///    - Callers can pass any sliceable type without conversion
///    - No need for multiple overloads (e.g., one for `&Vec<T>` and one for `&[T; N]`)
///
/// ## When to Apply This Rule
/// - When your function only needs to read/process elements
/// - When the operation doesn't depend on the container type
/// - When you want to accept both arrays and vectors
/// - For string processing (use `&str` instead of `&String`)
///
/// ## Common Sliceable Types
/// | Type          | Slice Type   | Example Function Parameter |
/// |---------------|--------------|----------------------------|
/// | Vec<T>        | &[T]         | `&[T]`                     |
/// | [T; N]        | &[T]         | `&[T]`                     |
/// | String        | &str         | `&str`                     |
/// | Box<[T]>      | &[T]         | `&[T]`                     |
///
/// ## Exceptions
/// - When you specifically need container methods (e.g., `Vec::push`)
/// - When you need to modify the container itself (not just its elements)
/// - When you need ownership of the container

fn slice_golden_rule() {

    // Works with:

    // EXERCISE: uncomment below and modify print_greeting so that
    // it accepts both &String and &'static str
    // print_greeting("hello"); // string literal (&'static str)

/// # Rust Lifetimes
///
/// ## 1. The Core Concept
/// Lifetimes are Rust's way of ensuring that references are always valid.
/// They track how long references can be safely used.
///
/// !!! The Golden Rule !!! : A reference cannot outlive the data it refers to
///
/// ## 2. The Problem They Solve
/// ```rust
/// // This would create a dangling reference:
/// fn dangling_reference() -> &i32 {
///      let x = 5;          // x is created
///      &x                  // Try to return reference to x
/// }                      // x is dropped here - reference becomes invalid!
/// ```
/// Lifetimes prevent this by ensuring references don't outlive their data.
///
/// ## 3. Lifetime Basics
/// - Every reference (`&T`) has a lifetime
/// - Most lifetimes are inferred by the compiler
/// - You only need to specify them when there's ambiguity
///
/// ## 4. Syntax
/// ```rust
/// &i32        // Reference with inferred lifetime
/// &'a i32     // Reference with explicit lifetime 'a
/// &'a mut i32 // Mutable reference with lifetime 'a
/// ```
///
/// ## 5. Key Properties
/// - Most lifetimes are invisible (compiler infers them)
/// - They don't change how long data lives
/// - They only affect references, not owned types
/// - Zero runtime cost (checked at compile time)
///
/// ## 6. Remember
/// - If code compiles without explicit lifetimes, you're good
/// - Lifetime errors mean a reference might outlive its data
/// - Solution: restructure so references don't outlive their data
///
/// ## 7. Lifetime Elision Rules
/// The compiler uses these rules to infer lifetimes:
/// 1. Each input reference gets its own lifetime
/// 2. If one input lifetime, it's assigned to all outputs
/// 3. For methods with `&self`, self's lifetime is assigned to outputs
#[test]
fn lifetime_example() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = String::from("world");

    // The reference must live as long as what it refers to

    // EXERCISE: uncomment the code below
    //
    // fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
    //    if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
    // }
    //
    // let result = longest(&s1, &s2);
    // println!("The longest string is {}", result);

    // EXERCISE: lets break things down and understand what happens
    // - understand lifetime elision
    // - how to fix the error
    // - this function is defined for any &str (this is the issue)
